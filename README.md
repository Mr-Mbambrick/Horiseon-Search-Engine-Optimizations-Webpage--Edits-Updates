# 0. Project Overview: #

This was our first challenge through The Adelaide of Universits Coding bootcamp. our challenge was a mock up of an" on the the- Job Ticket&mdash" which meant we were given a starter code that we need to refactor and Modifiy. The starter code was missing key elements that were needed in order for the webpage to meet Accessibility standards and it was not optimzed for search engies. our job was to Refactor the code, make the webapge more Accessiible to the end user, espically those with health barries and by following the "Scout Rule" we nedded to leave the code cleaner then we have found it. through implmeting all we have learnt from our Teaching Staff, the website now meets Accesanbtly criteria, the code has been debugged and cleaned up with the website now being optimsezed for serach engies & with all CSS codes being corrently layed out and all links are now working as it should.

 # 3.Installation #

To Install My project, users will need to save a copy on their local drive. First the User will need to open up Git Bash and open the file they wish to save my project in. for example using the command "cd" follewd by your folder of choice name - it will open and choose that folder you wish  to save it into.
To now save my project the user will need to download my SSH key on github and use the command GIT CLONE on git bash to clone the Project to their device. 

once this command has been done- once more use "Cd" followed by the folder where you saved my project- type Cd+folder name- to open saved location.

once the folder is opened- use command "LS" to see if my project was saved succesfuly and is listed. (LS stands for list directories )
if you can see it there use command cd followed by my project name- which in this case is this commmand " Cd Horiseon-Search-Engine-Optimizations-Webpage--Edits-Updates " 
once this has been opended run the command " code ." which will open my project in Visual code-which i used to comeplte this project.

once Visual Studio has opended ,you can see my project heading along the left hand side- and under this heading you will find three sub headings,
index.html 
css style 

to view my code- open index.html. here you will find my refactored code. to now view the webpage- go to the index.html file tab at the top of the page- right click your mouse and scroll down to the option:" open in default browser" once you do this you will be redirected to updated webpage. 

watch the video below for an example on how to open my project- once alreay clonned to device. please note folder names will changed based on the users saved names.
